This is a demo of a Next.js application with Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

View the demo: [https://next-on.netlify.app](https://next-on.netlify.app)

The demo is hosted on Netlify. Minimal configuration required thanks to [the next-on-netlify npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-on-netlify).
next-on-netlify makes server-side rendering possible by using Netlify functions under the hood.
